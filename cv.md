### About Myself:

Since graduating from university, I started my career as an accountant with Zhlobin Mechanical Plant Dnipr. However, soon our plant declared itself bankrupt and began the liquidation process. So I ended up out of work. 

At that time, my husband, who was fond of programming, got a job as a Java Developer in Minsk. We moved to the Capital and I also thought about changing my specialization.

By a lucky coincidence, I found out about the RS School where I study now at Course «JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0». I really hope that with my best efforts and attention, I will be able to master this area of knowledge.
